# applied-ai-systems

A 24-week applied AI systems engineering portfolio focused on:
- GPU-accelerated machine learning (CUDA on Jetson / MPS on Apple Silicon)
- Computer vision & real-time inference
- Model optimization (ONNX / TensorRT)
- Deployment (FastAPI + Docker)
- Reliability, monitoring, and performance engineering

## Repo structure
Each week has its own folder with code, notes, and deliverables.

## Devices supported
- NVIDIA Jetson (CUDA)
- Apple Silicon Mac (MPS / Metal)
- CPU fallback

## How to run Week 1
See: `week01_foundations/train_gpu.py`
