📘 Applied AI Systems — Engineering AI That Ships

Author: Shane Tyler
Focus: Applied AI, ML Systems, GPU Acceleration, Hardware-Aware Deployment

🔍 What This Repository Is

This repository documents a 24-week applied AI specialization focused on building, deploying, benchmarking, and validating real-world AI systems.

Unlike research or notebook-only projects, this work emphasizes:

Performance tradeoffs (CPU vs GPU vs eGPU)

Failure modes and diagnostics

Deployment readiness

Hardware and infrastructure constraints

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end AI engineering competence suitable for:

Applied AI Engineer

AI Systems Engineer

ML Infrastructure / Deployment Engineer

AI Test & Reliability Engineer

Robotics / Autonomy Data Engineer
